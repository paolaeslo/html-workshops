        <h2>Importance of Networking</h2>
        <blockquote cite="https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/learn-to-code-book/">
          <p>So much of getting a job is who you know.</p>
          <p>It's OK to be an introvert, but you do need to push your boundaries.</p>
          <p>Create GitHub, Twitter, LinkedIn, and Discord accounts.</p>
          <p>Go to tech meetups and conferences. Travel if you have to.</p>
